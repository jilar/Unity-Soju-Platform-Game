##Notes

* Make sure to updated the meeting notes from the scrum meeting outside of class.
* When work is finished, and milestones completed, strikethrough the requirement line to show progress,  ~~such as this~~
* You have to write a completed by: for each strikethrough.
* Example: ~~"Prepare health manager and mechanism for all relavant players to have a health component - Omar"~~ Completed by John Doe.
* Your requirements and intended features may change during scrums. Make sure you update this Readme if that happens(I support active change in reqs).
* Make sure you attend class regularly and show me the completed requirements in class. I will be interviewing teams every Saturday for grading purposes.
* Individual grading criteria: Saturday interviews, github commits, eventual team review form.
* Group Grading criteria: The usual grading criterial at the end of the project.(Fun to play, no bugs, Good contextual art, other minor things).
* You have been allocated Git LFS storage space on GitHub. You must use it if you intend to upload large files.
